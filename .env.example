# DO NOT commit .env.local to version control

# =================================
# Application Configuration
# =================================

# Application Mode
# SIMULATION: Use mock data (no API needed) - Good for UI development
# DEV: Connect to development API server
# PROD: Connect to production API server
# Application Port (default: 3000)
APP_PORT=3000

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=SIMULATION

# =================================
# API Configuration
# =================================
# Used in DEV and PROD modes only
# For local development, replace with your machine's IP address
# Find your IP:
#   - macOS: ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'
#   - Linux: hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
#   - Windows: ipconfig | findstr IPv4
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://192.168.1.100

# =================================
# Docker Configuration (Optional)
# =================================
# Only needed if you're using Docker Hub
# DO NOT commit real values to git!
DOCKER_LOGIN_USERNAME=your_docker_username
IMAGE_NAME=race-board

# =================================
# API Security
# =================================
# Required for API authentication (DEV and PROD modes)
# This token is used for Bearer token authentication with the SpeedStream API
# All API endpoints (except /health) require this token
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here

# =================================
# API Proxy Configuration
# =================================
# Set to 'true' to use Next.js API proxy (recommended for HTTPS with self-signed certificates)
# The proxy handles SSL certificate verification on the server side, avoiding browser SSL errors
# Set to 'false' to connect directly to the API from the browser (only works with valid SSL certs)
# Default: false
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_API_PROXY=true

# =================================
# SSL Configuration (Local Development Only)
# =================================
# ⚠️ WARNING: ONLY for local development with self-signed certificates
# ⚠️ NEVER set this to 0 in production! Remove this line in production.
# This setting allows Node.js (server-side) to accept self-signed SSL certificates
# Required when NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_API_PROXY=true and using HTTPS with self-signed certificates
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0

# =================================
# HTTPS Configuration (Production)
# =================================
# For production, always use HTTPS URLs
# Example: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
